Input: List of dD points
Output: Combinatorial map of dD polyhedron
(Output conversion: what format does ex. geomview take?)

Quickhull steps
Find d+1 non-coplanar points, ideally extreme
Set up into simplex (make triangles between every trio of points, but how are they connected?)
Store one dart from each facet in list, initialize empty list of points corresponding to for each facet
Check if points are above facets
	- Find d-1D directed hyperplane through facets
	- Find signed distance from point to facet
	- Does CGAL provide these things?
Sort points into outside sets
	- List of outside sets corresponding to list of facets
	- Save distance to not have to recalculate it to find furthest point? 
Pick a facet, get furthest point, find visible set
	- Start with facet it is above
	- Go to adjacent facets (need way to get adjacent facets)
	- Keep track of which facets have been visited (this is a search) (what data structure to use for this? Or mark them?)
	- Find boundary of visible region (ppt has example of how to do this) and get ridges on it
Form facets connecting those ridges to furthest point
	- Deal with possibility that coplanar facets are created :/ (again see ppt)
	- Write function to do this joining
	- Link facets to their neighbors
Remove facets in visible set from list of facets, add their points to unsorted list
Sort points again

Dealing with degenerate cases: Bad. A secondary stage

Hyperplanes, construction of and distance to: contained in the dD geometric kernel of CGAL
To use exact types or inexact types? 
Combinatorial maps DOES have adjacency yay
What attributes should I store? 

DONE:
Distance from d-D point to point
