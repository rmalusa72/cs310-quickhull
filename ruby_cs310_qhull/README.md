"/animations" contains gifs of successive cross sections of 4d hulls - see report for details of how they were made
"/code" contains qhull_3.cpp and qhull_4.cpp, the source code for the executables in the main folder
"cube.txt" is an example input file describing the vertices of a 3D cube
"/pics" contains a variety of pictures, many of which are used in the report, but if you want more they're there
"qhull_3" and "qhull_4" are executables of the quickhull implementations created in this project
"quickhull_project_report.pdf" is my report
"/teapot" contains a .off file of the Utah Teapot and of its hull as generated by qhull_3, as well as a file containing the points making it up



Compiling qhull_3.cpp or qhull_4.cpp, whcih are located in /code, requires CGAL and thus CGAL's dependencies, as well as gmp and mpfr. If the executables do not work, they should be compilable with 

c++ -std=c++11 -lcgal qhull_3.cpp -o qhull_3 -lboost_serialization -lgmp
c++ -std=c++11 -lcgal qhull_4.cpp -o qhull_4 -lboost_serialization -lgmp

after which they can be run with 

./qhull_3 (flags)
./qhull_4 (flags)

For an explanation of each flag, run 

./qhull_3 h
